Data Mining Techniques Assignment 1 

Hi and welcome to the Data Mining Techniques Assignment 1 repo. In case you might be unfamiliar with git/github, I have written some instructions and linked some tutorials at the bottom of this readme. 


## GitHub instructions for beginners, by a mediocre GitHub user

> I will try to cover as much a the basics as I can, but since this second nature for me, I might skip some things.

### initializing the repository
To start using GitHub in VSCode you will need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine and the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) VSCode extension in VSCode (which you should have installed as well). To install the VSCode extension go to the left column in VSCode and go to the fifth icon (extensions), search for 'GitHub Pull Requests and Issues', and install this package.  
next your will need to clone the you need to clone the FoB repository locally. You can do that either via the command line using `git clone https://github.com/ajhdr/FoB`. note: GitHub is a privacy freak, so it will ask you for your username and password. However you don't enter your password here. Instead you enter your 'Personal access tokens'. In order to get a Personal access token, you go to github > settings (right end corner) > developer mode > personal access tokens > generate new token > enter note (a name), set expiration, select all repo scopes, and generate token. Copy this code somewhere as you can only see it once.  
You can also open/clone this repo via VSCode: go the the left column third icon for the top, click on initialize repository and enter the [GitHub link](https://github.com/NicoleTabarini/DMTassignment1). Select the location for the repository folder. Open the folder in VSCode.  
You should be able to work in VSCode now

### switching branches
Git allows us to work on the same files at the same time and track our changes. A small problem that comes with this is that the last one to save their changes (commit) might overwrite other peoples their commits. This is why I created a separate branch for everyone. In this branch you can do the work by yourself and we can later merge the changes in the main branch. This way no one loses their work and we can compare solutions. To switch to your branches go to the bottom left corner in VSCode and switch to the branch with your name.

### Tutorials

To get more familiar with git you just need to work with it, but here are some helpful links: [VSCode on source control](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol), [VSCode on GitHub](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github), and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2DBSH2VoHQ&ab_channel=Ihatetomatoes)

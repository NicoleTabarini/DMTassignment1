Data Mining Techniques Assignment 1 

Hi and welcome to the Data Mining Techniques Assignment 1 repo. The aim of the assignment was to, given some temporal data, predict the outcome of the next day and compare the performance of standard machine learning techniques vs models especially built to work with temporal data.


In this project, we investigated whether we can predict mood using smartphone use and activity data using standard machine learning algorithms including support vector regression in combination with a sliding window protocol and a more sophisticated autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) based model.
